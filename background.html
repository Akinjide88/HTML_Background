            HTML is great, but HTML alone is plain and boring. 
            This was the case during early days of the Internet: web pages were very basic, 
            text-only sites. Then came along CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), 
            which allowed us to put some color and style into our web pages! 
            It’s like the difference between black & white and color TV.

            Hypertext markup language. It is the language that web browsers read to build a web page. 
            It acts as a ‘blueprint’ to display data on a user’s screen. This is the basic building block of the web. 
            Every page on the Internet is just HTML at its core.

            Before we jump into learning about a couple more HTML elements, 
            let’s learn about another way to supply data to an element. 
            We know that we can supply text between two tags, 
            but what if what we are trying to display cannot be textually based? 
            We can include this data with special flags right inside of our tags. 
            This is known as an attribute. 
            We will see attributes in action in the next section.
